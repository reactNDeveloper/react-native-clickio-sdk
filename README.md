# React Native Clickio SDK

A React Native wrapper for the [Clickio Consent SDK](https://www.clickio.com/), enabling GDPR/CCPA-compliant user consent management with native integrations for iOS and Android.  
This SDK supports integrations with third-party tools like Firebase, Adjust, Airbridge, and AppsFlyer.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements

Before integrating the ClickioConsentSdk (hereinafter referred to as the **Clickio SDK**), ensure that your React Native application meets the following requirements:

### Android

- **Minimum SDK Version**: 21 (Android 5.0)
- **Target/Compile SDK Version**: The minimum required for Google Play compliance.
- **Permissions**: Add the following to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

---

### iOS

- **Minimum iOS Version**: 15.0+
- **Swift Version**: 5.0+
- **Permissions**: Add the following to your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSUserTrackingUsageDescription</key>
<string>Add your data usage description</string>
```

---

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
npm install react-native-clickio-sdk
```

For iOS, install pods:

```bash
npx pod-install
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### iOS

1. Make sure your project uses at least `use_frameworks!` in your `ios/Podfile`.
2. In your iOS native app, ensure `Info.plist` includes appropriate permissions if your implementation uses tracking (e.g., `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription`).
3. Your iOS project must be configured for Swift (if it‚Äôs not, add a dummy `.swift` file to prompt Xcode to create a Bridging Header).

#### CocoaPods

Ensure your podspec includes necessary dependencies:

```ruby
s.dependency 'ClickioConsentSDK'
```

> Note: The WebView-based dialog shown by the SDK requires a valid `rootViewController`.

---

### Android

# Linking (React Native 0.59 and below)

If you are using React Native 0.59 or below, you need to link the native modules manually:

In your `android/build.gradle`:

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

In your `android/app/build.gradle`:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.clickio.consent:sdk:1.0.0'
}
```

---

### Initialization

```ts
import {
  initializeSDK,
  openDialog,
  setClickioLogging,
} from "react-native-clickio-sdk";

const initConsent = async () => {
  const result = await initializeSDK("your-site-id", "en", "default");
  console.log(result); // ClickioConsentSDK initialized
};
```

## Setup and Usage

### App Tracking Transparency (ATT) Permission

`Clickio SDK` supports [two distinct scenarios](#example-scenarios) for handling ATT permissions If your app collects and shares user data with third parties for tracking across apps or websites, **you must**:

1. Add the [`NSUserTrackingUsageDescription`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/BundleResources/Information-Property-List/NSUserTrackingUsageDescription) key in your `Info.plist`.
2. Choose an ATT permission handling strategy using the [`openDialog`](#opening-the-consent-dialog) method.

If you're managing ATT permissions manually and have already added [`NSUserTrackingUsageDescription`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/BundleResources/Information-Property-List/NSUserTrackingUsageDescription), you can skip ATT integration here and just use the consent flow.

#### Important:

- **make sure that user has given permission in the ATT dialog and only then perform [`openDialog`](#opening-the-consent-dialog) method call! Showing CMP regardless given ATT Permission is not recommended by Apple. Moreover, [`openDialog`](#opening-the-consent-dialog) API call can be blocked by Apple until user makes their choice.**

üëâ See [User Privacy and Data Use](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/) and [App Privacy Details](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/) for more details.

---

### Singleton Access

## All methods should be accessed via a singleton instance of the SDK:

---

### Handling SDK Readiness

Make sure to use SDK methods **after** the SDK is fully ready. You can do this via your app lifecycle or after `initialize`

### Handling `singleTask` Launch Mode and Consent Dialog

When your app's Android MainActivity is configured with `launchMode="singleTask"` (set in `AndroidManifest.xml`), returning to the app (e.g., via the launcher icon) can cause the Consent Dialog to close unexpectedly.

To ensure the Consent Dialog is displayed correctly when the launch mode set to `"singleTask"`, you should listen to app lifecycle events and reopen the dialog if needed when the app becomes active again.

#### Example:

```ts
const appState = useRef<AppStateStatus>(AppState.currentState);

useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = AppState.addEventListener(
    "change",
    handleAppStateChange
  );
  return () => {
    subscription.remove();
  };
}, []);

const handleAppStateChange = async (nextAppState: AppStateStatus) => {
  if (
    appState.current.match(/inactive|background/) &&
    nextAppState === "active"
  ) {
    // initialize
  }
  appState.current = nextAppState;
};
```

#### Opening the Consent Dialog

To open the consent dialog:

```dart
await openDialog(
  mode: resurface, // or defaultMode
  attNeeded: true,
);
```

#### Parameters:

- `mode` - defines when the dialog should be shown. Possible values::
  - `defaultMode` ‚Äì Opens the dialog if GDPR applies and user hasn't given consent.
  - `resurface` ‚Äì Always forces dialog to open, regardless of the user‚Äôs jurisdiction, allowing users to modify settings for GDPR compliance or to opt out under US regulations.
- `attNeeded`: Determines if ATT is required.

> üí° If your app has its own ATT Permission manager you just pass `false` in `attNeeded` parameter and call your own ATT method. Keep in mind that in this case consent screen will be shown regardless given ATT Permission.

### Enable Logging

```ts
await setClickioLogging(true); // Enables verbose mode in native SDK logs
````

## Utility Methods

## ü§ù Integration with Third-Party Libraries for Google Consent Mode

### :rocket: Adjust, Airbridge, AppsFlyer

If your project includes any of these SDKs **(Adjust, Airbridge, AppsFlyer)**, `ClickioConsentSDK` will automatically send Google Consent flags to them if _Clickio Google Consent Mode_ integration is **enabled**.

#### :warning: Important:

- Interactions with `ClickioConsentSDK` should be performed **after initializing the third-party SDKs** since `ClickioConsentSDK` only transmits consent flags.
- **Ensure** that you have completed the required tracking setup for Adjust, Airbridge, or AppsFlyer before integrating `ClickioConsentSDK`. This includes proper initialization and configuration of the SDK according to the vendor‚Äôs documentation.
- If you're using **AppsFlyer** and need to support GDPR compliance via TCF, make sure to enable TCF data collection before SDK initialization: `enableTCFDataCollection(true)`. This allows AppsFlyer to automatically gather consent values (like `tcString`) from the CMP.
  After successfully transmitting the flags, a log message will be displayed **(if logging is enabled)** to confirm the successful transmission. In case of an error, an error message will appear in the logs.
  > :bulb: **Note:** Keep your **Adjust**, **Airbridge**, or **AppsFlyer SDK** updated to ensure compatibility

```ts
import {
  isFirebaseAvailable,
  isAdjustAvailable,
  isAirbridgeAvailable,
  isAppsFlyerAvailable,
} from "react-native-clickio-sdk";

const checkSDKs = async () => {
  const firebase = await isFirebaseAvailable();
  const adjust = await isAdjustAvailable();
  const airbridge = await isAirbridgeAvailable();
  const appsFlyer = await isAppsFlyerAvailable();

  console.log({ firebase, adjust, airbridge, appsFlyer });
};
```

The SDK will automatically set the correct consent mode values for each integration if available, ensuring compliance without additional configuration.

### Firebase Analytics Integration

If the **Firebase Analytics SDK** is present in the project, the Clickio SDK will automatically send Google Consent flags to Firebase **if Google Consent Mode integration is enabled**.

- Consent flags are sent:

  - Immediately after the user gives or updates consent (when `onConsentUpdated` is triggered).
  - During initialization if the consent has already been accepted.

- After successfully transmitting the flags:
  - A log message will appear (if logging is enabled).
  - If an error occurs, an error message will appear in the logs.

> üîÑ Make sure you're using a compatible version of Firebase Analytics. You may need to update to the latest version if issues arise.
